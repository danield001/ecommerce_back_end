## About the Project
The E-Commerce Back End is a mysql database application, that allows users to store data within a databse, which can then be accessed through the use of sequelize of application updates and changes. This helps create a seamless use of the application for the user, and allows for one-to-one and one-to-many asscociation to help create a more indepth database for the user. 

### Features
* **Update and Create into the Model**: users can input changes into the databse with a post request; users can create, update and delete from all models via post requests. 
* **One-to-One and One-to-Many Association**: With associations, users can access an array of data through different means. The application amkes it easy for users to find groups of products relating to eachother, and allows for users to create more associations. 
* **MYSQL**: users can run MYSQL to store the database to their local workbench, allowing them to access the data being stored within the system, and changes being made.
